1) Change the lattice of properties by adding (Undefined or X) values for predicates. 
2) Improve the handling of bound action when only one partner is fixed. 


-> Compression may be two permissives. 
1) We should allow only permutation with a causal ancestor (causal dependence is not checked yet).
